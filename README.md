# Basic-Clock-Cpp
his repository contains a simple digital clock program written in C++. The program displays time in the format HH:MM:SS with AM/PM indicators and simulates real-time updates using a traditional nested loop.

🚀 Features

Accepts user input for the initial time in the format HH:MM:SS.

Simulates a real-time clock using a delay created by a large iteration loop.

Displays time in 12-hour format with AM/PM indicators.

Clears the console to provide a clean, refreshing display.

🛠️ Requirements

A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

Basic terminal/command-line knowledge to run the program.

📦 Usage

Compile the program:

g++ clock.cpp -o clock

Run the program:

./clock

Enter the starting time in HH MM SS format when prompted.

✨ Example

Enter the Time in Format HH:MM:SS
12 45 30
12 : 45 : 30 PM

🧑‍💻 How It Works

Input Handling: Users enter the initial time in HH:MM:SS format.

Loop Delay: The program uses a large traditional loop running from 0 to 99999999 to simulate a 1-second delay.

Display Logic: A nested loop iterates through hours, minutes, and seconds, refreshing the console to display updated time continuously.

AM/PM Detection: The program determines AM or PM based on the hour value.
