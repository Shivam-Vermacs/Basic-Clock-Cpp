# Basic-Clock-Cpp
A basic digital clock program in C++ that displays time in the format HH:MM:SS with AM/PM indicators. It accepts user input for the initial time and uses a traditional nested loop with a large iteration count to simulate a real-time delay. This simple implementation is perfect for beginners exploring time-based logic and loops in C++.
